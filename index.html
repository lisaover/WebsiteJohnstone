                    Americas in Mexico City. Barbara pursued graduate courses at the University of Toledo in Health Education and earned two Masters Degrees from Eastern Michigan University in Special Education, in the fields of Mental Impairment and
                    Learning Disabilities. Her career has spanned teaching at the elementary, junior high, and high school levels. Her area of expertise is developing reading skills in children at all grade levels, using a multi-sensory approach to learning.</p>

                <p>Barbara received an outstanding merit award from the Michigan Education Association&rsquo;s <span class="italic">Showcasing Public Schools</span>, for creating and developing an innovative program that transformed the approach to learning
                    for secondary students. She served as House Corporation President for Beta Mu Chapter of Delta Gamma, Bowling Green State University, for nine years and was instrumental in the chapter being named the Most Outstanding House Corporation
                    in the nation in 2014. Barbara is a member of the Society of Children&rsquo;s Book Writers and Illustrators and the Toledo Area Children&rsquo;s Book Writers and Illustrators. She is passionate about helping young people find the joy
                    in reading. </p>

                <p>Barbara resides in Toledo, Ohio with her husband, Gerry. She recently completed a fiction book for middle grade level readers, entitled
                    <span class="italic">Cemetery Ridge</span>. In this novel, Lacey Tracey, a sixth grader, and her friends are lured into the midst of intrigue as mysteries begin to unfold in their strange hometown, centered around the disappearance
                    of a local youngster, a tragic fire that occurred ten years before and an eerie graveyard for which the town was named.</p>
